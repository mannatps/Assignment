He stated that although the bodies were much abused and\\nstripped of everything of any value, they were recognized and interred\\nin four large graves. General Butler was found in the shattered remains\\nof his tent. After he had been wounded, he was carried to the tent;\\nwhile two surgeons were dressing his wounds, a ball struck one of them\\nin the hip. At that instant, an Indian, who was determined to have\\nButler’s scalp, rushed in. While attempting to scalp the General, he was\\nshot by the dying surgeon.\\n\\nIn December, 1793, General Wayne arrived with his army at Greenville and\\nsent forward a detachment to the spot of St. Clair’s Defeat. They\\narrived on Christmas Day and pitched their tents on the battleground.\\nBefore the men could make their beds in their tents that night, they had\\nto gather the bones together and carry them out. The next day graves\\nwere dug and the bones remaining above ground were buried. Six hundred\\nskulls were among them. The flesh was entirely off the bones, but in\\nmany cases the sinews yet held them together. After this melancholy duty\\nwas performed, a fortification was built and named Fort Recovery in\\ncommemoration of its being recovered from the Indians who had been in\\npossession of the ground since 1791. On the completion of the fort, one\\ncompany of artillerymen and one of riflemen were left there; the others\\nreturned to Greenville.\\n\\n  Henry Howe, HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS OF OHIO (Cincinnati: Published by\\n  the state of Ohio, 1908), Vol. II, pp. 223-32.\\n\\n\\nThe terrible battle known as St. Clair’s Defeat was fought on the\\nmorning of November 4, 1791, in what is now the northwestern part of\\nDarke County, Ohio, near the Indiana boundary. Early in the preceding\\nspring General St. Clair had received orders to raise and organize an\\narmy, to march into the wilderness as far as the junction of the St.\\nMary’s and the St. Joseph rivers, and to establish a line of military\\nposts from Fort Washington at Cincinnati to the present site of Fort\\nWayne. The forts were intended to keep the Indians in wholesome dread of\\nthe power of the whites and to prevent those fearful depredations which\\nhad already done so much to check the advancing tide of civilization. In\\nthe execution of these orders, St. Clair surmounted many serious\\nobstacles. After building Forts Hamilton and Jefferson, he reached a\\nbranch of the Wabash and encamped there in supposed security on the\\nevening of the third of November. His army numbered between two and\\nthree thousand men. Several hundred women and children, the families of\\nthe soldiers, traveled with the army.\\n\\nSt. Clair’s great and fatal mistake was in his fancied security. Instead\\nof having a large number of experienced scouts to scour the wilderness\\nfar in advance of the main army and to warn him of danger, he marched\\nblindly forward as if passing through friendly territory. The Indians\\nproved themselves more circumspect, for their scouts and runners had not\\nbeen idle and had brought their leaders intelligence of the whites. To\\ncheck and punish what they regarded as an invasion of their territory,\\nthe Indians collected a great force and marched forward to battle with\\ntheir enemies. Because of the American commander’s neglect, these dusky\\nsons of the forest were enabled to concoct their plans without\\nsuspicion, to arrange their attack without detection, and to carry out\\ntheir designs with the most terrible effect.\\n\\nAbout half an hour before sunrise on the fourth of November, the Indians\\nfiercely attacked the militia posted in front of the main army. The\\nfirst ranks made a slight resistance and then fell back in wild disorder\\nto the main camp. The overwhelming force of savages, led by their most\\ndistinguished chiefs, came rushing on with yells of fury, creating panic\\nand confusion impossible to describe. Then began a desperate fight and a\\nfearful slaughter. Though taken completely by surprise, the brave\\nsoldiers seized their arms, rallied under their respective leaders, and\\nstood their ground like heroes. Their first regular fire checked the\\nonset of the foe to some degree, but the Indians were too great in\\nnumbers and held too great an advantage to give way permanently. In a\\nshort time our gallant soldiers were violently assailed on all sides,\\nand officers and men went down before the deadly rifle fire like leaves\\nbefore the blasts of autumn wind. Several charges were ordered and made\\nwith great spirit. The savages at times gave way before the impetuous\\ncharges of their disciplined foes, yet it was only to rally in greater\\nforce and to press more fearfully upon some weaker point.\\n\\nFor three hours the battle raged with wild fury, and the ground\\neverywhere was covered with the dead and dying. General St. Clair saw\\nwith dismay that the day was hopelessly lost. Four of his own horses had\\nalready been killed, his clothes were riddled with bullets, and nearly\\nevery officer had been cut down. Under these distressing circumstances,\\nthere was but one thing for him to do. He gave the order to retreat.\\n\\nThis retreat, as might have been anticipated, soon became a rout of the\\nmost terrible kind. The Indians, finding themselves masters of the field\\nand finding their enemies flying in wild disorder, rushed after the\\nfugitives with yells of triumph. They followed the soldiers for four or\\nfive miles, shooting, tomahawking, or scalping all they could overtake.\\nThen the most eager of the savages, satisfied with their morning’s work,\\ngave up the chase and returned to the battlefield to gather the scalps\\nof the dead and dying. Nearly all of the wounded were butchered. Those\\nunfortunate ones who had been taken unharmed were generally reserved for\\nlater tortures, and there were enough captives to provide many holidays\\nfor the different tribes.\\n\\nWe have thus given a brief sketch of the disaster on that woeful day.\\nThe details of that horrifying scene of conflict would fill volumes.\\nThis we cannot do. We can, however, piece together a narrative from the\\nrecords of the actors in that dreadful tragedy. It is our purpose to\\npublish the story of Robert Branshaw, a Kentuckian, who has left behind\\nhim an account of what he saw and did on that memorable day.\\n\\n“The main camp was pitched in a level wood by a small stream which was\\none of the branches of the Wabash River; on higher ground about a\\nquarter of a mile across this stream, the militia and a company of\\nrangers had been on duty through the latter part of the night and were\\nprepared for an attack by Indians whom we knew to be in front of us. We\\nsupposed them to be a mere scouting party sent out to gather information\\nabout our movements. We did not think that they planned anything more\\nserious than to pick off some of our number and to get a few scalps if\\nthey could do so without serious risk. Certain it is, we were not\\nprepared for what took place.\\n\\n“In the gray of the morning, before objects had become distinct at any\\nconsiderable distance, I was standing near one of the fires conversing\\nwith a comrade. Suddenly I saw twenty or thirty painted savages dodging\\naround among the trees in front of us, as if they planned to attack by\\nsurprise. Supposing the ones I saw to be the entire party, and thinking\\nit a good chance to bring down one of them and at the same time to alarm\\nthe camp, I instantly raised my rifle to my eye, took a quick aim, and\\ndropped the nearest Indian. The smoke had not cleared away from my rifle\\nwhen a terrific volley was poured in upon us. It was accompanied by\\nappalling yells from a thousand throats. At the same instant I saw\\nIndians springing from behind their covers and rushing down upon us in\\noverwhelming numbers. Instantly, I turned to fly and stumbled over the\\ndead body of the comrade with whom I had been conversing. He had been\\nshot through the temples, and he was the first dead man I saw on that\\nfatal day.\\n'], ['\\nSeveral survivors of St. Clair’s Defeat wrote vivid accounts of their\\nexperiences during that terrible battle. These personal reports detail\\none of the worst defeats ever suffered by an American army. Encouraged\\nby victories over the forces of Generals Harmar and St. Clair, the\\nIndians preyed upon the defenseless frontier. Therefore, the success of\\nGeneral Wayne’s expedition, undertaken in 1792 to subdue the redskins,\\nwas of primary importance to the development of the West.\\n\\nThe first of the three articles in this pamphlet contains the accounts\\nwhich Henry Howe included in his HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS OF OHIO, first\\npublished in 1847. Sources of quotations used in Howe’s COLLECTIONS are\\nnot always clear, but the material is considered of sufficient\\nhistorical significance to warrant reprinting without exact citations.\\nThe second item appeared in the INDIANA HERALD on April 13, 1864. The\\nthird article is a brief newspaper report which was published in the\\nINDIANA STATE JOURNAL on September 27, 1851.\\n\\nThe Boards and the Staff of the Public Library of Fort Wayne and Allen\\nCounty present this publication in the hope that it will prove\\ninteresting to the general public as well as to students of the history\\nof the Old Northwest. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation have been\\nchanged to conform to current usage.\\n\\n\\nThe great objective of St. Clair’s campaign was to establish a military\\npost at the Miami village (the site of the present city of Fort Wayne)\\nat the junction of the St. Mary’s and St. Joseph rivers. Intermediate\\nposts of communication were to be maintained from that place to Fort\\nWashington at Cincinnati. This was felt to be the only way to prevent\\nfuture hostilities.\\n\\nActing under instructions, St. Clair proceeded to organize his army. At\\nthe close of April, 1791, he was at Pittsburgh where troops and\\nmunitions of war were being collected. On the fifteenth of May he\\nreached Fort Washington. The expedition was expected to start before the\\nfirst of August, but mismanagement in the quartermaster’s department and\\nother hindrances prevented the departure for many weeks. From Fort\\nWashington the troops advanced only six miles to Ludlow’s Station. The\\narmy of 2,300, exclusive of the militia, remained there until September\\n17, when it moved forward and built Fort Hamilton on the Great Miami\\nRiver. From there the army marched forty-four miles farther and built\\nFort Jefferson. On the twenty-fourth of October the toilsome march\\nthrough the wilderness began. We copy below from the NOTES ON THE EARLY\\nSETTLEMENT OF THE NORTH-WESTERN TERRITORY by Judge Jacob Burnet.\\n\\n“During this time 300 militiamen deserted and returned to their homes.\\nThe supplies for the army were still in the rear, and General St. Clair\\nwas afraid that the deserters might seize them for their own use. He\\ndecided very reluctantly to send the first regiment back for the dual\\npurpose of bringing up the provisions and, if possible, of overtaking\\nand arresting some of the deserters.\\n\\n“After that arrangement had been made, the army resumed its march; and\\non the third of November, it arrived at a creek flowing toward the\\nsouthwest. This stream was thought to be the St. Mary’s River, one of\\nthe principal branches of the Maumee River; but it was afterward\\nascertained to be a branch of the Wabash River. Since it was late in the\\nafternoon and the men were fatigued by the laborious march, they\\nencamped on a commanding piece of ground by the creek.\\n\\n“General St. Clair intended to occupy that position until the first\\nregiment arrived with the provisions. According to a plan he had made\\nwith Major Ferguson, he intended to begin work on a fort the next day;\\nbut he was not permitted to do so. Half an hour before sunrise on the\\nfourth of November, just after the men had been dismissed from parade,\\nthe Indians attacked the militiamen posted at the front. By rushing back\\ninto camp with the Indians close upon their heels, they threw the army\\ninto disorder from which it could not recover. In a short time the\\nIndians were checked by the fire of the first line, but they immediately\\nconcentrated a very heavy fire on that line; and in a few minutes they\\nextended their fire to the second line.\\n\\n“In each case their heaviest fire was directed into the center of the\\nline where the artillery was placed, and men were frequently driven from\\nthe center with great slaughter. Bayonets were resorted to in that\\nemergency. Under orders from St. Clair, Colonel Darke made a spirited\\ncharge with a part of the second line. The Indians instantly gave way\\nand were driven back several hundred yards. But there was not a\\nsufficient number of riflemen to preserve the advantage, and the enemy\\nsoon renewed the attack and forced our troops to retreat.'], ['charge was made with great success by the battalions of Majors Butler\\nand Clark. Several other charges were made with equal effect. These\\nattacks, however, caused a heavy loss of men, particularly of officers.\\nIn the charge made by the second regiment, Major Butler was dangerously\\nwounded. All but three of the officers of that regiment fell, and one of\\nthese three was shot through the body. The cannon was silenced, and all\\nthe artillery officers were killed except Captain Ford who was\\ndangerously wounded. Half the army had fallen; it was necessary to gain\\nthe road, if possible, and to make a retreat.\\n\\n“A successful charge was made on the enemy, as if to turn their right\\nflank, but in reality to reach the road. The militia then commenced to\\nretreat, followed by the United States troops, with Major Clark’s\\nbattalion covering the rear. The retreat, as might be expected, soon\\nbecame a flight. The camp was abandoned and so was the artillery for\\nthere were no horses to move it. For about four miles the road was\\nalmost covered with the arms and accouterments which the men continued\\nto throw away even after the Indians had stopped pursuing them.\\n\\n“All of General St. Clair’s horses had been killed, and he was mounted\\non a broken-down packhorse that could scarcely be forced out of a walk.\\nIt was, therefore, impossible for him to get forward to command a halt;\\nand the orders which he dispatched by others for that purpose were not\\nexecuted. The rout continued until about dark when the remnant of the\\narmy arrived at Fort Jefferson, twenty-seven miles from the\\nbattleground. The battle had lasted about three hours; it began a half\\nhour before sunrise, and the retreat did not start until nine-thirty in\\nthe morning. With only one exception, the troops behaved with great\\nbravery during this time; this accounts for the very large number of\\ncasualties.\\n\\n“Among those killed were Major General Butler, Colonel Oldham, Major\\nFerguson, Major Hart, and Major Clark. Among the wounded were Colonel\\nSargeant (the adjutant-general), Colonel Darke, Colonel Gibson, Major\\nButler, and Viscount Malartie, who served as an aide. In addition to\\nthese, the list of officers killed contained the names of Captains\\nBradford, Phelon, Kirkwood, Price, Van Swearingen, Tipton, Purdy, Smith,\\nPiatt, Gaither, Crebbs, and Newman; Lieutenants Spear, Warren, Boyd,\\nMcMath, Burgess, Kelso, Read, Little, Hopper, and Lickins; Ensigns Cobb,\\nBalch, Chase, Turner, Wilson, Brook, Beatty, and Purdy; Quartermasters\\nReynolds and Ward; Adjutant Anderson; and Dr. Grasson. In addition to\\nthe wounded officers whose names are mentioned above, the official list\\ncontains the names of Captains Doyle, Truman, Ford, Buchanan, Darke, and\\nHough; Lieutenants Greaton, Davidson, DeButts, Price, Morgan, McCrea,\\nLysle, and Thompson; Adjutants Whistler and Crawford; and Ensign Bines.\\nThe melancholy result of that disastrous day was felt and lamented by\\nall who had sympathy for private distress or public misfortune.\\n\\n“The only allegation made by General St. Clair against his army was that\\nthe men lacked discipline, a quality which could not have been developed\\nduring the short time the men were in the service. That defect rendered\\nit impossible to restore order once the men were thrown into confusion,\\nand this is the chief reason why the loss fell so heavily on the\\nofficers. They were compelled to expose themselves to an unusual degree\\nin their efforts to rally the men and to overcome the want of\\ndiscipline. Although worn down by sickness and suffering from a painful\\ndisease, General St. Clair set the example. It was alleged by the\\nofficers that the Indians far outnumbered the American troops. That\\nconclusion was drawn, in part, from the fact that the Indians outflanked\\nand forcefully attacked all sides of the American lines at the same\\ntime.\\n\\n“When the fugitives arrived at Fort Jefferson, the first regiment was\\njust returning from its unsuccessful effort either to overtake the\\ndeserters or to meet the convoy of provisions. The absence of that\\nregiment at the time of the battle was believed by some men to have been\\nthe cause of the defeat. They supposed that had it been present the\\nIndians would have been defeated or would have attacked at another time.\\nGeneral St. Clair seemed to think it uncertain, judging from the\\nsuperior number of the enemy, whether he ought to consider the absence\\nof that corps fortunate or otherwise. On the whole, he seemed to think\\nit fortunate, for he gravely doubted whether its presence would have\\nchanged the fortune of the day. If it had not, the triumph of the enemy\\nwould have been more complete, and the country would have been left\\nwithout means of defense.\\n\\n“As soon as the troops reached Fort Jefferson, it became a question of\\nwhether they ought to stay there or return to Fort Washington. General\\nSt. Clair asked the advice of his surviving field officers; these\\nincluded Colonel Darke, Majors Hamtramck, Zeigler, and Gaither, and\\nColonel Sargeant. After discussing the subject, they reported\\nunanimously that they believed the troops could not be accommodated in\\nFort Jefferson nor could they be supplied with provisions there. The\\nofficers thought it proper to proceed immediately toward supplies which\\nwere known to be on the road not more than two marches distant. This\\nplan was adopted, and the army set out at ten o’clock and marched all\\nnight. The next day they met a convoy with a quantity of flour which was\\none day ahead of a drove of cattle. These supplies were used by the\\ntroops on their march to Fort Washington.'], ['“The loss sustained by the country in the fall of so many gallant\\nofficers and men was most seriously regretted. General Butler and Major\\nFerguson were spoken of with particular esteem. The public feeling,\\nhowever, was in some measure alleviated by the fact that those brave\\nmen, officers and privates, fell covered with honor while defending the\\ncause of their country.\\n\\n“The principal complaint made by the commander was that some of his\\norders given during the night to Colonel Oldham were not executed. He\\nalso complained that some very important information sent during the\\nnight by Captain Hough to General Butler was not imparted to him, and he\\ndid not hear of it until he arrived at Fort Washington.\\n\\n“Because of the almost treasonable negligence of the government agents\\nin furnishing supplies, the army had been on short allowances for many\\ndays. This had made it absolutely necessary either to retreat or to send\\nthe first regiment, which was the flower of the army, to bring up the\\nprovisions and military stores. The latter alternative was chosen, and\\nin the absence of that corps the attack was made. In regard to the\\nnegligence of the War Department, it is a well-authenticated fact that\\nboxes and packages were carelessly put up and marked. During the battle\\na box marked ‘flints’ was found to contain gunlocks; a keg of powder\\nmarked ‘for the infantry’ was found to be damaged cannon-powder that\\ncould scarcely be ignited.\\n\\n“Under all of these disadvantages, it was generally believed by candid,\\nintelligent men that the commanding general was not justly liable to\\nsevere censure. With one exception at the commencement of the action,\\nthe troops behaved with great bravery. They maintained their ground for\\nthree hours in an uninterrupted conflict with a superior force. They did\\nnot attempt to leave the field until it was covered with the bodies of\\ntheir companions and a retreat was ordered. The General, less anxious\\nfor himself than for others, was the last to leave the ground after he\\nhad ordered the retreat.'], ['“For some time after the disaster, St. Clair was universally censured.\\nAfter a thorough investigation, a committee of Congress, with Mr. Giles\\nof Virginia as chairman, found that the campaign had been conducted with\\nskill and personal bravery. The committee concluded that the defeat was\\ncaused chiefly by the lack of discipline in the militia and by the\\nnegligence of those whose duty it was to procure and forward the\\nprovisions and military stores necessary for the expedition.\\n\\n“Secretary of War Henry Knox addressed a letter to Congress complaining\\nthat an injustice had been done him by the committee. The report was\\nthen reconsidered by the same committee. After hearing the statements\\nand explanations of the Secretary and after reconsidering the whole\\nmatter, they reaffirmed their first report.”\\n\\nFrom one part of the country to the other, this defeat caused one loud\\nand merciless outcry of abuse and detestation of St. Clair. Many a\\ngeneral with far less bravery and military skill has, when successful,\\nbeen applauded by the unthinking multitude with vehement acclamations.\\nThe following excerpt from the narrative of St. Clair’s campaign shows\\nthat he deserved a better fate.\\n\\n“During the engagement, Generals St. Clair and Butler were continually\\ngoing up and down the lines; as one general went up one side, the other\\none went down the opposite side. St. Clair was so severely afflicted\\nwith the gout that he was unable to mount or dismount a horse without\\nassistance. His own four horses had been turned out to feed overnight,\\nbut they had been brought in before the battle. St. Clair first\\nattempted to ride a young horse, but the animal was so frightened by the\\nfiring that it could not be mounted. He had just moved the horse to\\nwhere he could have some advantage from the slope of the ground when the\\nhorse was shot through the head. The boy holding it was wounded in the\\narm. A second horse was brought and harnessed; but as St. Clair was\\nabout to mount, the animal and the servant who held it were killed. The\\nGeneral then ordered the third horse to be prepared and brought to him\\nat the left of the front line, which was then warmly engaged. The man\\nand horse were never heard of afterward, and it is supposed that they\\nwere killed. General St. Clair’s fourth horse was killed under the Count\\nde Malartie, one of his aides, whose horse had died on the march.\\n\\n    [Illustration: _the horse was shot through the head_]\\n'], ['coarse coat and a three-cornered hat. A long queue and heavy gray locks\\nflowed from under his beaver hat. Early in the action, a ball grazed the\\nside of his face and cut off a portion of one of his locks. It is said\\nthat during the battle eight balls passed through his clothes. After his\\nhorses were killed, he exerted himself on foot for a considerable time\\nwith a degree of alertness that surprised everybody who saw him. When he\\nwas nearly exhausted, a packhorse was brought to him. Although he could\\nscarcely prod the animal out of a walk, he rode it during the remainder\\nof the day. Had he not been furnished with a horse, he would have had to\\nremain on the field, even though he was unhurt.\\n\\n“During the action General St. Clair exerted himself with a courage and\\npresence of mind worthy of the best fortune. He gave his orders in\\nperson to Colonel Darke, and he was present when the first bayonet\\ncharge was made upon the enemy. When the Indians first entered the camp\\nby the left flank, General St. Clair led the troops which drove them\\nback. When a retreat became indispensable, he put himself at the head of\\nthe troops which broke through the enemy ranks and opened the way for\\nthe remainder of the army. When this was done, he remained in the rear\\nand made every exertion to obtain a party to cover the retreat. The\\npanic, however, was so great that his exertions were of little avail. At\\nthe height of the action, a few of the men crowded around the fires in\\nthe center of the camp; St. Clair was seen drawing his pistols,\\nthreatening them, and ordering them to turn and repel the enemy.”\\n\\nIn commenting upon the General’s honorable acquittal of all blame by the\\ncommittee of Congress appointed to inquire into the causes of the\\nfailure of the expedition, Chief Justice John Marshall, in his LIFE OF\\nGEORGE WASHINGTON, remarks with his usual felicity of expression: “More\\nsatisfactory testimony in favor of St. Clair is furnished by the\\ncircumstance that he still retained the undiminished esteem and good\\nopinion of President Washington.”\\n\\nTo the foregoing description of the battle we extract from the narrative\\nof Major Jacob Fowler his own personal experience in the events of that\\nfatal day. Charles Cist published Fowler’s story in his ADVERTISER, with\\nthe following introduction:\\n\\n“There was hardly a battle fought in the early struggles with the\\nIndians in which Mr. Fowler did not participate. He is now (July, 1844)\\neighty years old, but his eye has not dimmed nor his natural force\\nabated. He can still pick off a squirrel with his rifle at one hundred\\nyards. He can walk as firmly and as fast as most men of fifty, and I\\ncannot perceive a gray hair in his head. His mind and memory are as\\nvigorous as his physical body.”\\n\\nMajor Fowler’s story is as follows:\\n\\n“Excepting a single instance, St. Clair kept out no scouting parties\\nduring his entire march. We would have been completely surprised by the\\nattack if it had not been for volunteer scouting parties from the\\nmilitia who were out on the evening before the battle. The constant\\ndischarge of rifles throughout the night also warned us to prepare for\\nthe event. The militia, encamped about a quarter of a mile in front of\\nthe main army, received the first shock of the attack a little after\\ndaybreak. The camp was on the bank of a small creek, one of the upper\\nbranches of the Wabash River. The ground was nearly level and covered\\nwith a heavy growth of timber. As surveyor, I drew the pay and rations\\nof a subaltern; but as an old hunter, I was not disposed to trust myself\\namong the Indians without my rifle. Indeed, I found it very serviceable\\nduring the march, for the army never had more than half rations during\\nthe whole campaign.\\n\\n“My stock of bullets had become low from using them for hunting; and as\\nsoon as it was daylight that morning, I started for the militia camp to\\nget a ladle to pour some more. By this time the battle had begun, and I\\nmet the militia running into the main body of troops. I hailed one of'], ['the Kentuckians, whom I found disabled in the right wrist by a bullet;\\nand I asked him if he had bullets to spare. He told me to take out his\\npouch and to divide with him. I poured out a double handful, put back\\nwhat I supposed was half, and was about to leave him, when he said,\\n‘Stop, you had better count them.’ I could hardly resist the impulse to\\nlaugh, for the idea of counting a handful of bullets was ludicrous under\\nthe circumstances. ‘If we get through this day’s scrape, my dear\\nfellow,’ said I, ‘I will return you twice as many.’ But I never saw him\\nagain, and I suppose he shared the fate that befell many a gallant\\nspirit on that day. I owe the bullets, at any rate, at this moment.\\n\\n“When I returned to the lines, I found that the engagement had begun.\\nOne of Captain Piatt’s men lay shot through the belly near the spot I\\nhad left. I saw an Indian behind a small tree not twenty steps away and\\njust outside the regular lines. He was loading his piece, squatting down\\nas much as possible to screen himself. I sighted and shot him through;\\nhe dropped as soon as I had fired, and I retreated into our lines to\\nreload my rifle. Finding that the fire had ceased at this point, I ran\\nto the rear line, where I met Colonel Darke leading a charge with about\\nthree hundred men. I followed with my rifle. By this movement the\\nIndians were driven out of sight, and the Colonel called a halt to rally\\nhis men. A number of trees had been blown down near where we stood. As\\nan experienced woodsman and hunter, I suggested to Colonel Darke that\\nthese trees would form an excellent breastwork of sufficient length to\\nprotect the whole force. We might yet need that protection, for judging\\nby the shouting and firing, the Indians behind us had closed the gap we\\nhad made in charging. I told the Colonel that if we turned and charged\\nthe Indians at our rear, we should have them with their backs to us. No\\ndoubt we would be able to give a good account of them. ‘Lead the way,\\nthen,’ said the Colonel, as he rode to the rear to march the whole body\\nforward. We then charged the Indians, but they were so thick that we\\ncould do nothing with them. In a few minutes they had surrounded us, and\\nwe found ourselves beside the army baggage and the artillery, which had\\nbeen captured. I then climbed a tree. After firing twelve or fourteen\\ntimes, two or three rods being my longest shot, I discovered that many\\nof those whom I had struck were not brought down. I had not then had\\nsufficient experience to know that I must shoot them in the hip to bring\\nthem down. The unprotected regulars armed with muskets could do little\\nbetter than to fire at random.\\n\\n    [Illustration: _While he was crawling away_]\\n\\n“By this time only about thirty men of Colonel Darke’s command were left\\nstanding; the rest were lying around us, either killed or wounded. I ran\\nto the Colonel, who was waving his sword in the thickest of it to\\nencourage his men, and told him we should all be down in five minutes if\\nwe did not charge. ‘Charge, then!’ said he to the little line that\\nremained, and they did so. Fortunately, the main army charged on the\\nother side at the same time, and the Indians were momentarily put to\\nflight.\\n\\n“I had been partially sheltered by a small tree, but two Indians behind\\na larger tree fired simultaneously at me. Feeling the stream of air\\nfollowing the passage of their shots, I supposed myself cut to pieces;\\nbut no harm had been done. I brought my piece to my side and fired\\nwithout aiming at the one that stood his ground. The fellow was so close\\nto me that I could hardly miss him, and I shot him through the hips.\\nWhile he was crawling away on all fours, Colonel Darke, who had\\ndismounted and stood close by me, cut off the Indian’s head. By this\\ntime the cock of my rifle lock had worn loose and gave me much trouble.\\nI told my difficulty to an acquaintance from Cincinnati who had picked\\nup a gun from a militiaman. ‘There is a first-rate rifle,’ he said,\\npointing to one at a distance. I ran to get it as soon as I ascertained\\nthat my bullets would fit it.\\n\\n“Here I met Captain J. S. Gano, who was unarmed. I handed him the rifle\\nI had gone into the battle with, and I told him that we were defeated\\nand would have to make our escape as speedily as possible. If we\\nescaped, we would need the rifles for subsistence in the woods. While\\nthe battle still raged, a group of soldiers had gathered together, but\\nthey did little more than present targets for the enemy. The soldiers\\nappeared stupefied and bewildered. At another spot a group of soldiers\\nhad broken into the officers’ marquees and were eating the breakfast\\nfrom which the officers had been called. It must be remembered that\\nneither officers nor men had eaten anything the whole morning. Some of\\nthe men were shot down in the very act of eating.\\n\\n“Just where I then stood, no Indians were visible, although their rifle\\nballs were striking all around. At last I saw an Indian dash for a tree\\nabout forty yards off. From this protection he loaded and fired four\\ntimes, bringing down his man at every shot. He fired too quickly to give\\nme a chance to aim at him. At length I got a range of two inches inside\\nhis backbone and blazed away; down he fell, and I saw no more of him.\\n\\n“A short time later I heard the cry given by St. Clair and his adjutant\\nsergeant to charge to the road. I ran through the disorganized army to\\nwhere I had left my relative, Captain Piatt, and I told him that the\\narmy was broken up and in full retreat. ‘Don’t say so,’ he replied. ‘You\\nwill discourage my men, and I can’t believe it.’ I persisted a short\\ntime, but finding him obstinate, I said, ‘If you will rush your fate, in\\nGod’s name do it!’ I then ran off toward the rear of the army, which was\\nrapidly retreating.\\n\\n“Piatt called, ‘Wait for me!’ It was no use to stop, for by this time\\nthe savages were hardly twenty yards behind me. Being uncommonly active\\nin those days, I soon got from the rear to the front of the troops; but\\nI had great trouble in avoiding the bayonets which the retreating men\\nhad thrown down with the sharp points toward their pursuers.\\n\\n“It has been stated that the Indians followed us for thirty miles, but\\nthis is not true. My duty as surveyor led me to mark the miles every day\\nwe proceeded on our march, and it was therefore easy to ascertain how\\nfar we were pursued. The Indians, after every other fire, fell back to\\nload their rifles and regained the lost distance by running on afresh.\\n\\n“Even during the last charge of Colonel Darke, the bodies of the dead\\nand dying were shrouded with smoke and in the heavy morning frost looked\\nlike so many pumpkins in a cornfield in December. It was on the fourth\\nof November, and the day was severely cold for the season. My fingers\\nbecame so benumbed at times that I had to take the bullets in my mouth\\nand load from it, while I had the wiping rod in my hand to force them\\ndown.”\\n\\nThe map of the battleground is taken from the survey of John S. Houston\\nof Celina. The localities were pointed out to him by Mr. McDowell, who\\nwas in the action and who is now living near Fort Recovery. In a letter\\nheaded Celina, March 20, 1847, Mr. Houston reported on a conversation\\nwith Mr. McDowell.\\n\\n“Mr. McDowell states that on the morning of the battle he and several\\nothers had just gone out to look after their horses when suddenly they\\nheard discharges of musketry and the most hideous yells from the'], ['opposite side of the river. Instantly, he rushed to camp where his\\nregiment was preparing for action. He joined them and gallantly charged\\nthe enemy. On the retreat he was among those who defended the rear and\\nkept the enemy in check for several miles. The ground was covered with a\\nslushy snow which greatly retarded their progress. After a while many\\nsoldiers became so dispirited and hungry—having eaten no breakfast—that\\nthey threw down their arms and made their way as best they could among\\nthe retreating crowd.\\n\\n“About this time, Mr. McDowell saw a mother carrying her year-old\\ninfant. She was so tired that she was about to fall by the wayside when\\nhe took the child and carried it some distance. Afterward, to save her\\nown life, the woman left the child in the snow. The Indians carried it\\nto the Sandusky towns and reared it. Soon after this, McDowell overtook\\na youth about eighteen years old who was hobbling along, wounded in the\\nleg. McDowell gave him a drink of spirits and a little bread, although\\nhe himself had not had time to eat. This refreshed and encouraged the\\nyoung man; and when a pony came dashing by, McDowell caught it and\\nmounted the young soldier upon it. In this way the youth reached the\\nfort safely.\\n\\n    [Illustration: PLAN OF ST. CLAIR’S BATTLEFIELD]\\n\\n                              REFERENCES:\\n  A.

When I arrived at Georgetown, I entered my\\nname on the hotel register with the place of my residence—Fort Recovery,\\nOhio.\\n\\n“‘After I had been sitting some time at ease before a comfortable fire,\\na gentleman who had noticed the entry of my name and residence opened a\\nfriendly conversation about the place and country. He soon remarked that\\nhe was at the defeat of St. Clair, and that if it had not been for the\\nassistance of a young man of Butler’s regiment, he would have been there\\nyet.’\\n\\n“After a few more questions and replies, both men recognized each other.\\nThe gentleman was the youth who had been shot during the retreat and\\nwhose life had been saved with McDowell’s assistance. At this discovery\\ntheir surprise and consequent mutual attachment may be imagined. The\\ngentleman insisted upon taking McDowell home and introducing him to his\\nwife and daughters. He had become a wealthy merchant and gave McDowell a\\nnew suit of clothes and other presents which he has carefully preserved\\nto this day.”\\n\\nIn his SKETCHES OF WESTERN ADVENTURE, John A. McClung relates some\\nanecdotes which show the heroism and activity of a young man who was in\\nthis action.\\n\\n“The late William Kennan, of Fleming County, when a young man of\\neighteen, was attached to the corps of rangers who accompanied the\\nregular force. He had long been noted for his strength and activity. In\\nthe course of the march from Fort Washington, he had repeated\\nopportunities to test his astonishing physical powers; and it was\\nuniversally admitted that he was the swiftest runner in the light corps.\\nOn the evening preceding the action, his corps had been advanced a few\\nhundred yards in front of the first line of infantry in order to give\\nreasonable notice of the enemy’s approach. Just as day was dawning, he\\nobserved about thirty Indians within one hundred yards of the guards’\\nfire. They advanced cautiously toward the spot where he stood with about\\ntwenty rangers; the other men were considerably in the rear.\\n\\n    [Illustration: _mounted the young soldier_]\\n\\n“Supposing it to be a mere scouting party, numbering no more than the\\nrangers, he sprang forward a few paces in order to shelter himself in a\\nspot of rank grass. After firing with a quick aim upon the foremost\\nIndian, Kennan instantly fell flat upon his face and proceeded with all\\npossible rapidity to reload his gun. He did not doubt for a moment that\\nthe rangers would maintain their positions and support him. The Indians,\\nhowever, rushed forward in such overwhelming numbers that the rangers\\nwere compelled to run. Kennan was in total ignorance of his danger until\\nhis captain, who had observed him when he threw himself into the grass,\\nsuddenly shouted, ‘Run, Kennan! or you are a dead man!’ Instantly,\\nKennan sprang to his feet and beheld Indians within ten feet of him; his\\ncompany was already more than one hundred yards in front.\\n\\n“Not a moment was to be lost. He darted off with every muscle strained\\nto its utmost. A dozen yelling Indians were close behind him. At first\\nhe pressed straight forward to the ford in the creek which separated the\\nrangers from the main army. Several Indians, who had passed him before\\nhe rose from the grass, threw themselves in the way and completely cut\\nhim off from the other rangers. By the most powerful exertions, he left\\nall of the pursuers behind him, with the exception of one chief who\\ndisplayed a swiftness and perseverance equal to his own. The circuit\\nwhich Kennan was obliged to take extended the race for more than four\\nhundred yards. The distance between them was about eighteen feet, which\\nKennan could not increase nor his adversary diminish. Each runner put\\nhis whole soul into the race.\\n\\n“Kennan, as far as he was able, kept his eye upon the motions of his\\npursuer, for he was afraid the Indian would throw the tomahawk which he'], ['held aloft in a menacing position. At length, finding that no other\\nIndian was immediately at hand, Kennan determined to try the mettle of\\nhis pursuer in a different manner. He felt for his own tomahawk but\\ndiscovered it had slipped out of its sheath while he lay in the grass.\\nHis hair almost lifted the cap from his head when he realized he was\\ntotally unarmed! Kennan had slackened his pace for a moment, and the\\nIndian was almost in reach of him when he again sprinted forward. Fear\\nlent wings to his feet, and for the first time he saw himself\\noutdistancing the Indian. He had watched the motions of his pursuer too\\nclosely, however, to pay proper attention to the nature of the ground\\nbefore him; and he suddenly found himself in front of a large tree which\\nhad been blown down. Brush and other impediments increased the height of\\nthe obstacle to eight or nine feet.\\n\\n“The Indian, who heretofore had not uttered the slightest sound, now\\ngave a short, quick yell as if sure of his victim. Kennan had not a\\nmoment to deliberate. He must clear the tree at a leap or perish.\\nPutting his whole soul into the effort, he bounded into the air with a\\npower that astonished himself. Clearing limbs, brush, and everything\\nelse, he alighted in perfect safety on the other side. A loud yell of\\nastonishment burst from his pursuer, who had not the hardihood to\\nattempt the same feat. Kennan, as may be readily imagined, had no\\nleisure to enjoy his triumph but dashed into the bed of the creek. With\\nits high banks shielding him from the fire of the enemy, he ran up the\\nstream until he found a convenient place to cross. Soon he rejoined the\\nrangers in the rear of the encampment. He was panting from the fatigue\\nof exertions which have seldom been surpassed, but no breathing time was\\nallowed him. The attack instantly commenced and, as we have already\\nobserved, was maintained for three hours with unabated fury.\\n\\n    [Illustration: _he alighted in perfect safety_]\\n\\n“When the retreat commenced, Kennan was attached to Major Clark’s\\nbattalion which was assigned the task of protecting the rear. This corps\\nquickly lost its commander and was completely disorganized. Kennan was\\namong the hindmost when the fight commenced; but by exerting those same\\npowers which had saved him in the morning, he quickly gained the front\\nand passed several horsemen in the flight. Here he beheld a private of\\nhis own company, an intimate acquaintance, lying upon the ground with\\nhis thigh broken. In the most piercing tones of distress, the wounded\\nman implored each horseman who hurried by to take him up behind him. As\\nsoon as he beheld Kennan coming on foot, he stretched out his arms and\\ncalled aloud for help. Notwithstanding the imminent peril of the moment,\\nKennan could not reject so passionate an appeal and carried him for\\nseveral hundred yards. Horseman after horseman passed them, but each\\nrider refused to take the wounded man.\\n\\n“At length the enemy was gaining upon them so fast that Kennan saw their\\ndeaths to be certain unless he relinquished his burden. Accordingly, he\\ntold his friend that he had used every possible exertion to save his\\nlife and that he must relax his hold around his neck or they would both\\nperish. The unhappy man, heedless of every remonstrance, still clung\\nconvulsively and impeded Kennan’s exertions until the foremost of the\\nenemy, armed with tomahawk alone, was within twenty yards of them.\\nKennan then drew his knife from its sheath and cut the fingers of his\\ncompanion. The unhappy man rolled upon the ground in utter helplessness.\\nHe was tomahawked before Kennan had gone thirty yards. Relieved of his\\nburden, Kennan darted forward with a speed which once more brought him\\nto the front. Here again he was compelled to neglect his own safety in\\norder to attend to that of others.\\n\\n“The late Governor George Madison of Kentucky, who afterward commanded\\nthe troops who defended themselves so honorably at Raisin River, was a\\nman of amiable temper and unconquerable courage. At that time, he was a\\nsubaltern in St. Clair’s army. His health was poor; and now, totally\\nexhausted by the exertions of the morning, he was calmly sitting on a\\nlog awaiting the approach of his enemies. Kennan hastily accosted him\\nand inquired the cause of his delay. Madison, pointing to a wound which\\nhad bled profusely, replied that he was unable to walk any farther and\\nthat he had no horse. Kennan instantly ran back to a spot where he had\\nseen an exhausted horse grazing and caught it without difficulty. Having\\nassisted Madison to mount, he walked beside the animal until they were\\nout of danger. Fortunately, the pursuit soon ceased, as the plunder of\\nthe camp presented irresistible attractions to the enemy. The friendship\\nthus formed between these two young men endured without interruption for\\nthe rest of their lives. Kennan never entirely recovered from the severe\\nexertions which he had been compelled to make during this unfortunate\\nexpedition. He settled in Fleming County where he was a leading member\\nof the Baptist church for many years. He died in 1827.”\\n\\nThe number of Indians engaged in this action can never be ascertained\\nwith any degree of certainty. Estimates have varied from one to three\\nthousand. Colonel John Johnston, long an Indian agent in this region,\\nhad many opportunities to form a correct opinion on this subject. His\\nstatements in a letter of 1846 are worthy of consideration.\\n\\n“The number of Indians at the defeat of St. Clair must have been large.\\nAt that time game was plentiful, and a large number of Indians could\\nhave subsisted easily. Wells, one of our interpreters, was there and\\nfought for the enemy. To use his own language, he tomahawked and scalped\\nthe wounded, dying, and dead, until he was unable to raise his arm. The\\nprincipal tribes in the battle were the Delaware, Shawnee, Wyandot,\\nMiami, and Ottawa. A few Indians of the Chippewa and Potawatomi tribes\\nwere also present. I had no accurate means of knowing the total number,\\nbut it could not have been less than two thousand.”\\n\\nSome time after the defeat of St. Clair, General Wilkinson, who had\\nbecome commander of Fort Washington, ordered an expedition to visit the\\nbattleground. Captain Buntin, who was with the party, afterward wrote a\\nletter to St. Clair from which the following is extracted.\\n\\n“In my opinion, those unfortunate men who were captured alive suffered\\nthe greatest torture by having their limbs torn off. The women were\\ntreated with the most indecent cruelty; stakes as thick as a person’s\\narm were driven through their bodies. The former I observed while\\nburying the dead; the latter was discovered by Colonel Sargeant and Dr.\\nBrown. We found three carriages whole; the other five were so badly\\ndamaged that they were useless. By the General’s orders, we dug pits in\\ndifferent places and buried all the bodies that were exposed to view or\\nthat could be found conveniently.\\n\\n“During this time several small parties were detached—some to protect\\nthe main group and others to examine the course of the creek. At some\\ndistance in front of the ground occupied by the militia, these parties\\nfound a large camp, not less than three quarters of a mile long. They\\nthought it had been the camp of the Indians the night before the action.\\nWe remained on the field that night, and the next morning we hitched\\nhorses to the carriages and started for Fort Jefferson.']]\n"

He stated that although the bodies were much abused and\\r\\nstripped of everything of any value, they were recognized and interred\\r\\nin four large graves. General Butler was found in the shattered remains\\r\\nof his tent. After he had been wounded, he was carried to the tent;\\r\\nwhile two surgeons were dressing his wounds, a ball struck one of them\\r\\nin the hip. At that instant, an Indian, who was determined to have\\r\\nButler’s scalp, rushed in. While attempting to scalp the General, he was\\r\\nshot by the dying surgeon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, 1793, General Wayne arrived with his army at Greenville and\\r\\nsent forward a detachment to the spot of St. Clair’s Defeat. They\\r\\narrived on Christmas Day and pitched their tents on the battleground.\\r\\nBefore the men could make their beds in their tents that night, they had\\r\\nto gather the bones together and carry them out. The next day graves\\r\\nwere dug and the bones remaining above ground were buried. Six hundred\\r\\nskulls were among them. The flesh was entirely off the bones, but in\\r\\nmany cases the sinews yet held them together. After this melancholy duty\\r\\nwas performed, a fortification was built and named Fort Recovery in\\r\\ncommemoration of its being recovered from the Indians who had been in\\r\\npossession of the ground since 1791. On the completion of the fort, one\\r\\ncompany of artillerymen and one of riflemen were left there; the others\\r\\nreturned to Greenville.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Henry Howe, HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS OF OHIO (Cincinnati: Published by\\r\\n  the state of Ohio, 1908), Vol. II, pp. 223-32.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe terrible battle known as St. Clair’s Defeat was fought on the\\r\\nmorning of November 4, 1791, in what is now the northwestern part of\\r\\nDarke County, Ohio, near the Indiana boundary. Early in the preceding\\r\\nspring General St. Clair had received orders to raise and organize an\\r\\narmy, to march into the wilderness as far as the junction of the St.\\r\\nMary’s and the St. Joseph rivers, and to establish a line of military\\r\\nposts from Fort Washington at Cincinnati to the present site of Fort\\r\\nWayne. The forts were intended to keep the Indians in wholesome dread of\\r\\nthe power of the whites and to prevent those fearful depredations which\\r\\nhad already done so much to check the advancing tide of civilization. In\\r\\nthe execution of these orders, St. Clair surmounted many serious\\r\\nobstacles. After building Forts Hamilton and Jefferson, he reached a\\r\\nbranch of the Wabash and encamped there in supposed security on the\\r\\nevening of the third of November. His army numbered between two and\\r\\nthree thousand men. Several hundred women and children, the families of\\r\\nthe soldiers, traveled with the army.\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Clair’s great and fatal mistake was in his fancied security. Instead\\r\\nof having a large number of experienced scouts to scour the wilderness\\r\\nfar in advance of the main army and to warn him of danger, he marched\\r\\nblindly forward as if passing through friendly territory. The Indians\\r\\nproved themselves more circumspect, for their scouts and runners had not\\r\\nbeen idle and had brought their leaders intelligence of the whites. To\\r\\ncheck and punish what they regarded as an invasion of their territory,\\r\\nthe Indians collected a great force and marched forward to battle with\\r\\ntheir enemies. Because of the American commander’s neglect, these dusky\\r\\nsons of the forest were enabled to concoct their plans without\\r\\nsuspicion, to arrange their attack without detection, and to carry out\\r\\ntheir designs with the most terrible effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout half an hour before sunrise on the fourth of November, the Indians\\r\\nfiercely attacked the militia posted in front of the main army. The\\r\\nfirst ranks made a slight resistance and then fell back in wild disorder\\r\\nto the main camp. The overwhelming force of savages, led by their most\\r\\ndistinguished chiefs, came rushing on with yells of fury, creating panic\\r\\nand confusion impossible to describe. Then began a desperate fight and a\\r\\nfearful slaughter. Though taken completely by surprise, the brave\\r\\nsoldiers seized their arms, rallied under their respective leaders, and\\r\\nstood their ground like heroes. Their first regular fire checked the\\r\\nonset of the foe to some degree, but the Indians were too great in\\r\\nnumbers and held too great an advantage to give way permanently. In a\\r\\nshort time our gallant soldiers were violently assailed on all sides,\\r\\nand officers and men went down before the deadly rifle fire like leaves\\r\\nbefore the blasts of autumn wind. Several charges were ordered and made\\r\\nwith great spirit. The savages at times gave way before the impetuous\\r\\ncharges of their disciplined foes, yet it was only to rally in greater\\r\\nforce and to press more fearfully upon some weaker point.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor three hours the battle raged with wild fury, and the ground\\r\\neverywhere was covered with the dead and dying. General St. Clair saw\\r\\nwith dismay that the day was hopelessly lost. Four of his own horses had\\r\\nalready been killed, his clothes were riddled with bullets, and nearly\\r\\nevery officer had been cut down. Under these distressing circumstances,\\r\\nthere was but one thing for him to do. He gave the order to retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis retreat, as might have been anticipated, soon became a rout of the\\r\\nmost terrible kind. The Indians, finding themselves masters of the field\\r\\nand finding their enemies flying in wild disorder, rushed after the\\r\\nfugitives with yells of triumph. They followed the soldiers for four or\\r\\nfive miles, shooting, tomahawking, or scalping all they could overtake.\\r\\nThen the most eager of the savages, satisfied with their morning’s work,\\r\\ngave up the chase and returned to the battlefield to gather the scalps\\r\\nof the dead and dying. Nearly all of the wounded were butchered. Those\\r\\nunfortunate ones who had been taken unharmed were generally reserved for\\r\\nlater tortures, and there were enough captives to provide many holidays\\r\\nfor the different tribes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have thus given a brief sketch of the disaster on that woeful day.\\r\\nThe details of that horrifying scene of conflict would fill volumes.\\r\\nThis we cannot do. We can, however, piece together a narrative from the\\r\\nrecords of the actors in that dreadful tragedy. It is our purpose to\\r\\npublish the story of Robert Branshaw, a Kentuckian, who has left behind\\r\\nhim an account of what he saw and did on that memorable day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The main camp was pitched in a level wood by a small stream which was\\r\\none of the branches of the Wabash River; on higher ground about a\\r\\nquarter of a mile across this stream, the militia and a company of\\r\\nrangers had been on duty through the latter part of the night and were\\r\\nprepared for an attack by Indians whom we knew to be in front of us. We\\r\\nsupposed them to be a mere scouting party sent out to gather information\\r\\nabout our movements. We did not think that they planned anything more\\r\\nserious than to pick off some of our number and to get a few scalps if\\r\\nthey could do so without serious risk. Certain it is, we were not\\r\\nprepared for what took place.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the gray of the morning, before objects had become distinct at any\\r\\nconsiderable distance, I was standing near one of the fires conversing\\r\\nwith a comrade. Suddenly I saw twenty or thirty painted savages dodging\\r\\naround among the trees in front of us, as if they planned to attack by\\r\\nsurprise. Supposing the ones I saw to be the entire party, and thinking\\r\\nit a good chance to bring down one of them and at the same time to alarm\\r\\nthe camp, I instantly raised my rifle to my eye, took a quick aim, and\\r\\ndropped the nearest Indian. The smoke had not cleared away from my rifle\\r\\nwhen a terrific volley was poured in upon us. It was accompanied by\\r\\nappalling yells from a thousand throats. At the same instant I saw\\r\\nIndians springing from behind their covers and rushing down upon us in\\r\\noverwhelming numbers. Instantly, I turned to fly and stumbled over the\\r\\ndead body of the comrade with whom I had been conversing. He had been\\r\\nshot through the temples, and he was the first dead man I saw on that\\r\\nfatal day.\\r\\n'], ['\\r\\nSeveral survivors of St. Clair’s Defeat wrote vivid accounts of their\\r\\nexperiences during that terrible battle. These personal reports detail\\r\\none of the worst defeats ever suffered by an American army. Encouraged\\r\\nby victories over the forces of Generals Harmar and St. Clair, the\\r\\nIndians preyed upon the defenseless frontier. Therefore, the success of\\r\\nGeneral Wayne’s expedition, undertaken in 1792 to subdue the redskins,\\r\\nwas of primary importance to the development of the West.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of the three articles in this pamphlet contains the accounts\\r\\nwhich Henry Howe included in his HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS OF OHIO, first\\r\\npublished in 1847. Sources of quotations used in Howe’s COLLECTIONS are\\r\\nnot always clear, but the material is considered of sufficient\\r\\nhistorical significance to warrant reprinting without exact citations.\\r\\nThe second item appeared in the INDIANA HERALD on April 13, 1864. The\\r\\nthird article is a brief newspaper report which was published in the\\r\\nINDIANA STATE JOURNAL on September 27, 1851.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boards and the Staff of the Public Library of Fort Wayne and Allen\\r\\nCounty present this publication in the hope that it will prove\\r\\ninteresting to the general public as well as to students of the history\\r\\nof the Old Northwest. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation have been\\r\\nchanged to conform to current usage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great objective of St. Clair’s campaign was to establish a military\\r\\npost at the Miami village (the site of the present city of Fort Wayne)\\r\\nat the junction of the St. Mary’s and St. Joseph rivers. Intermediate\\r\\nposts of communication were to be maintained from that place to Fort\\r\\nWashington at Cincinnati. This was felt to be the only way to prevent\\r\\nfuture hostilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nActing under instructions, St. Clair proceeded to organize his army. At\\r\\nthe close of April, 1791, he was at Pittsburgh where troops and\\r\\nmunitions of war were being collected. On the fifteenth of May he\\r\\nreached Fort Washington. The expedition was expected to start before the\\r\\nfirst of August, but mismanagement in the quartermaster’s department and\\r\\nother hindrances prevented the departure for many weeks. From Fort\\r\\nWashington the troops advanced only six miles to Ludlow’s Station. The\\r\\narmy of 2,300, exclusive of the militia, remained there until September\\r\\n17, when it moved forward and built Fort Hamilton on the Great Miami\\r\\nRiver. From there the army marched forty-four miles farther and built\\r\\nFort Jefferson. On the twenty-fourth of October the toilsome march\\r\\nthrough the wilderness began. We copy below from the NOTES ON THE EARLY\\r\\nSETTLEMENT OF THE NORTH-WESTERN TERRITORY by Judge Jacob Burnet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“During this time 300 militiamen deserted and returned to their homes.\\r\\nThe supplies for the army were still in the rear, and General St. Clair\\r\\nwas afraid that the deserters might seize them for their own use. He\\r\\ndecided very reluctantly to send the first regiment back for the dual\\r\\npurpose of bringing up the provisions and, if possible, of overtaking\\r\\nand arresting some of the deserters.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After that arrangement had been made, the army resumed its march; and\\r\\non the third of November, it arrived at a creek flowing toward the\\r\\nsouthwest. This stream was thought to be the St. Mary’s River, one of\\r\\nthe principal branches of the Maumee River; but it was afterward\\r\\nascertained to be a branch of the Wabash River. Since it was late in the\\r\\nafternoon and the men were fatigued by the laborious march, they\\r\\nencamped on a commanding piece of ground by the creek.\\r\\n\\r\\n“General St. Clair intended to occupy that position until the first\\r\\nregiment arrived with the provisions. According to a plan he had made\\r\\nwith Major Ferguson, he intended to begin work on a fort the next day;\\r\\nbut he was not permitted to do so. Half an hour before sunrise on the\\r\\nfourth of November, just after the men had been dismissed from parade,\\r\\nthe Indians attacked the militiamen posted at the front. By rushing back\\r\\ninto camp with the Indians close upon their heels, they threw the army\\r\\ninto disorder from which it could not recover. In a short time the\\r\\nIndians were checked by the fire of the first line, but they immediately\\r\\nconcentrated a very heavy fire on that line; and in a few minutes they\\r\\nextended their fire to the second line.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In each case their heaviest fire was directed into the center of the\\r\\nline where the artillery was placed, and men were frequently driven from\\r\\nthe center with great slaughter. Bayonets were resorted to in that\\r\\nemergency. Under orders from St. Clair, Colonel Darke made a spirited\\r\\ncharge with a part of the second line. The Indians instantly gave way\\r\\nand were driven back several hundred yards. But there was not a\\r\\nsufficient number of riflemen to preserve the advantage, and the enemy\\r\\nsoon renewed the attack and forced our troops to retreat.'], ['charge was made with great success by the battalions of Majors Butler\\r\\nand Clark. Several other charges were made with equal effect. These\\r\\nattacks, however, caused a heavy loss of men, particularly of officers.\\r\\nIn the charge made by the second regiment, Major Butler was dangerously\\r\\nwounded. All but three of the officers of that regiment fell, and one of\\r\\nthese three was shot through the body. The cannon was silenced, and all\\r\\nthe artillery officers were killed except Captain Ford who was\\r\\ndangerously wounded. Half the army had fallen; it was necessary to gain\\r\\nthe road, if possible, and to make a retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A successful charge was made on the enemy, as if to turn their right\\r\\nflank, but in reality to reach the road. The militia then commenced to\\r\\nretreat, followed by the United States troops, with Major Clark’s\\r\\nbattalion covering the rear. The retreat, as might be expected, soon\\r\\nbecame a flight. The camp was abandoned and so was the artillery for\\r\\nthere were no horses to move it. For about four miles the road was\\r\\nalmost covered with the arms and accouterments which the men continued\\r\\nto throw away even after the Indians had stopped pursuing them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All of General St. Clair’s horses had been killed, and he was mounted\\r\\non a broken-down packhorse that could scarcely be forced out of a walk.\\r\\nIt was, therefore, impossible for him to get forward to command a halt;\\r\\nand the orders which he dispatched by others for that purpose were not\\r\\nexecuted. The rout continued until about dark when the remnant of the\\r\\narmy arrived at Fort Jefferson, twenty-seven miles from the\\r\\nbattleground. The battle had lasted about three hours; it began a half\\r\\nhour before sunrise, and the retreat did not start until nine-thirty in\\r\\nthe morning. With only one exception, the troops behaved with great\\r\\nbravery during this time; this accounts for the very large number of\\r\\ncasualties.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Among those killed were Major General Butler, Colonel Oldham, Major\\r\\nFerguson, Major Hart, and Major Clark. Among the wounded were Colonel\\r\\nSargeant (the adjutant-general), Colonel Darke, Colonel Gibson, Major\\r\\nButler, and Viscount Malartie, who served as an aide. In addition to\\r\\nthese, the list of officers killed contained the names of Captains\\r\\nBradford, Phelon, Kirkwood, Price, Van Swearingen, Tipton, Purdy, Smith,\\r\\nPiatt, Gaither, Crebbs, and Newman; Lieutenants Spear, Warren, Boyd,\\r\\nMcMath, Burgess, Kelso, Read, Little, Hopper, and Lickins; Ensigns Cobb,\\r\\nBalch, Chase, Turner, Wilson, Brook, Beatty, and Purdy; Quartermasters\\r\\nReynolds and Ward; Adjutant Anderson; and Dr. Grasson. In addition to\\r\\nthe wounded officers whose names are mentioned above, the official list\\r\\ncontains the names of Captains Doyle, Truman, Ford, Buchanan, Darke, and\\r\\nHough; Lieutenants Greaton, Davidson, DeButts, Price, Morgan, McCrea,\\r\\nLysle, and Thompson; Adjutants Whistler and Crawford; and Ensign Bines.\\r\\nThe melancholy result of that disastrous day was felt and lamented by\\r\\nall who had sympathy for private distress or public misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The only allegation made by General St. Clair against his army was that\\r\\nthe men lacked discipline, a quality which could not have been developed\\r\\nduring the short time the men were in the service. That defect rendered\\r\\nit impossible to restore order once the men were thrown into confusion,\\r\\nand this is the chief reason why the loss fell so heavily on the\\r\\nofficers. They were compelled to expose themselves to an unusual degree\\r\\nin their efforts to rally the men and to overcome the want of\\r\\ndiscipline. Although worn down by sickness and suffering from a painful\\r\\ndisease, General St. Clair set the example. It was alleged by the\\r\\nofficers that the Indians far outnumbered the American troops. That\\r\\nconclusion was drawn, in part, from the fact that the Indians outflanked\\r\\nand forcefully attacked all sides of the American lines at the same\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When the fugitives arrived at Fort Jefferson, the first regiment was\\r\\njust returning from its unsuccessful effort either to overtake the\\r\\ndeserters or to meet the convoy of provisions. The absence of that\\r\\nregiment at the time of the battle was believed by some men to have been\\r\\nthe cause of the defeat. They supposed that had it been present the\\r\\nIndians would have been defeated or would have attacked at another time.\\r\\nGeneral St. Clair seemed to think it uncertain, judging from the\\r\\nsuperior number of the enemy, whether he ought to consider the absence\\r\\nof that corps fortunate or otherwise. On the whole, he seemed to think\\r\\nit fortunate, for he gravely doubted whether its presence would have\\r\\nchanged the fortune of the day. If it had not, the triumph of the enemy\\r\\nwould have been more complete, and the country would have been left\\r\\nwithout means of defense.\\r\\n\\r\\n“As soon as the troops reached Fort Jefferson, it became a question of\\r\\nwhether they ought to stay there or return to Fort Washington. General\\r\\nSt. Clair asked the advice of his surviving field officers; these\\r\\nincluded Colonel Darke, Majors Hamtramck, Zeigler, and Gaither, and\\r\\nColonel Sargeant. After discussing the subject, they reported\\r\\nunanimously that they believed the troops could not be accommodated in\\r\\nFort Jefferson nor could they be supplied with provisions there. The\\r\\nofficers thought it proper to proceed immediately toward supplies which\\r\\nwere known to be on the road not more than two marches distant. This\\r\\nplan was adopted, and the army set out at ten o’clock and marched all\\r\\nnight. The next day they met a convoy with a quantity of flour which was\\r\\none day ahead of a drove of cattle. These supplies were used by the\\r\\ntroops on their march to Fort Washington.'], ['“The loss sustained by the country in the fall of so many gallant\\r\\nofficers and men was most seriously regretted. General Butler and Major\\r\\nFerguson were spoken of with particular esteem. The public feeling,\\r\\nhowever, was in some measure alleviated by the fact that those brave\\r\\nmen, officers and privates, fell covered with honor while defending the\\r\\ncause of their country.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The principal complaint made by the commander was that some of his\\r\\norders given during the night to Colonel Oldham were not executed. He\\r\\nalso complained that some very important information sent during the\\r\\nnight by Captain Hough to General Butler was not imparted to him, and he\\r\\ndid not hear of it until he arrived at Fort Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because of the almost treasonable negligence of the government agents\\r\\nin furnishing supplies, the army had been on short allowances for many\\r\\ndays. This had made it absolutely necessary either to retreat or to send\\r\\nthe first regiment, which was the flower of the army, to bring up the\\r\\nprovisions and military stores. The latter alternative was chosen, and\\r\\nin the absence of that corps the attack was made. In regard to the\\r\\nnegligence of the War Department, it is a well-authenticated fact that\\r\\nboxes and packages were carelessly put up and marked. During the battle\\r\\na box marked ‘flints’ was found to contain gunlocks; a keg of powder\\r\\nmarked ‘for the infantry’ was found to be damaged cannon-powder that\\r\\ncould scarcely be ignited.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Under all of these disadvantages, it was generally believed by candid,\\r\\nintelligent men that the commanding general was not justly liable to\\r\\nsevere censure. With one exception at the commencement of the action,\\r\\nthe troops behaved with great bravery. They maintained their ground for\\r\\nthree hours in an uninterrupted conflict with a superior force. They did\\r\\nnot attempt to leave the field until it was covered with the bodies of\\r\\ntheir companions and a retreat was ordered. The General, less anxious\\r\\nfor himself than for others, was the last to leave the ground after he\\r\\nhad ordered the retreat.'], ['“For some time after the disaster, St. Clair was universally censured.\\r\\nAfter a thorough investigation, a committee of Congress, with Mr. Giles\\r\\nof Virginia as chairman, found that the campaign had been conducted with\\r\\nskill and personal bravery. The committee concluded that the defeat was\\r\\ncaused chiefly by the lack of discipline in the militia and by the\\r\\nnegligence of those whose duty it was to procure and forward the\\r\\nprovisions and military stores necessary for the expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Secretary of War Henry Knox addressed a letter to Congress complaining\\r\\nthat an injustice had been done him by the committee. The report was\\r\\nthen reconsidered by the same committee. After hearing the statements\\r\\nand explanations of the Secretary and after reconsidering the whole\\r\\nmatter, they reaffirmed their first report.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom one part of the country to the other, this defeat caused one loud\\r\\nand merciless outcry of abuse and detestation of St. Clair. Many a\\r\\ngeneral with far less bravery and military skill has, when successful,\\r\\nbeen applauded by the unthinking multitude with vehement acclamations.\\r\\nThe following excerpt from the narrative of St. Clair’s campaign shows\\r\\nthat he deserved a better fate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“During the engagement, Generals St. Clair and Butler were continually\\r\\ngoing up and down the lines; as one general went up one side, the other\\r\\none went down the opposite side. St. Clair was so severely afflicted\\r\\nwith the gout that he was unable to mount or dismount a horse without\\r\\nassistance. His own four horses had been turned out to feed overnight,\\r\\nbut they had been brought in before the battle. St. Clair first\\r\\nattempted to ride a young horse, but the animal was so frightened by the\\r\\nfiring that it could not be mounted. He had just moved the horse to\\r\\nwhere he could have some advantage from the slope of the ground when the\\r\\nhorse was shot through the head. The boy holding it was wounded in the\\r\\narm. A second horse was brought and harnessed; but as St. Clair was\\r\\nabout to mount, the animal and the servant who held it were killed. The\\r\\nGeneral then ordered the third horse to be prepared and brought to him\\r\\nat the left of the front line, which was then warmly engaged. The man\\r\\nand horse were never heard of afterward, and it is supposed that they\\r\\nwere killed. General St. Clair’s fourth horse was killed under the Count\\r\\nde Malartie, one of his aides, whose horse had died on the march.\\r\\n\\r\\n    [Illustration: _the horse was shot through the head_]\\r\\n'], ['coarse coat and a three-cornered hat. A long queue and heavy gray locks\\r\\nflowed from under his beaver hat. Early in the action, a ball grazed the\\r\\nside of his face and cut off a portion of one of his locks. It is said\\r\\nthat during the battle eight balls passed through his clothes. After his\\r\\nhorses were killed, he exerted himself on foot for a considerable time\\r\\nwith a degree of alertness that surprised everybody who saw him. When he\\r\\nwas nearly exhausted, a packhorse was brought to him. Although he could\\r\\nscarcely prod the animal out of a walk, he rode it during the remainder\\r\\nof the day. Had he not been furnished with a horse, he would have had to\\r\\nremain on the field, even though he was unhurt.\\r\\n\\r\\n“During the action General St. Clair exerted himself with a courage and\\r\\npresence of mind worthy of the best fortune. He gave his orders in\\r\\nperson to Colonel Darke, and he was present when the first bayonet\\r\\ncharge was made upon the enemy. When the Indians first entered the camp\\r\\nby the left flank, General St. Clair led the troops which drove them\\r\\nback. When a retreat became indispensable, he put himself at the head of\\r\\nthe troops which broke through the enemy ranks and opened the way for\\r\\nthe remainder of the army. When this was done, he remained in the rear\\r\\nand made every exertion to obtain a party to cover the retreat. The\\r\\npanic, however, was so great that his exertions were of little avail. At\\r\\nthe height of the action, a few of the men crowded around the fires in\\r\\nthe center of the camp; St. Clair was seen drawing his pistols,\\r\\nthreatening them, and ordering them to turn and repel the enemy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn commenting upon the General’s honorable acquittal of all blame by the\\r\\ncommittee of Congress appointed to inquire into the causes of the\\r\\nfailure of the expedition, Chief Justice John Marshall, in his LIFE OF\\r\\nGEORGE WASHINGTON, remarks with his usual felicity of expression: “More\\r\\nsatisfactory testimony in favor of St. Clair is furnished by the\\r\\ncircumstance that he still retained the undiminished esteem and good\\r\\nopinion of President Washington.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the foregoing description of the battle we extract from the narrative\\r\\nof Major Jacob Fowler his own personal experience in the events of that\\r\\nfatal day. Charles Cist published Fowler’s story in his ADVERTISER, with\\r\\nthe following introduction:\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was hardly a battle fought in the early struggles with the\\r\\nIndians in which Mr. Fowler did not participate. He is now (July, 1844)\\r\\neighty years old, but his eye has not dimmed nor his natural force\\r\\nabated. He can still pick off a squirrel with his rifle at one hundred\\r\\nyards. He can walk as firmly and as fast as most men of fifty, and I\\r\\ncannot perceive a gray hair in his head. His mind and memory are as\\r\\nvigorous as his physical body.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor Fowler’s story is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excepting a single instance, St. Clair kept out no scouting parties\\r\\nduring his entire march. We would have been completely surprised by the\\r\\nattack if it had not been for volunteer scouting parties from the\\r\\nmilitia who were out on the evening before the battle. The constant\\r\\ndischarge of rifles throughout the night also warned us to prepare for\\r\\nthe event. The militia, encamped about a quarter of a mile in front of\\r\\nthe main army, received the first shock of the attack a little after\\r\\ndaybreak. The camp was on the bank of a small creek, one of the upper\\r\\nbranches of the Wabash River. The ground was nearly level and covered\\r\\nwith a heavy growth of timber. As surveyor, I drew the pay and rations\\r\\nof a subaltern; but as an old hunter, I was not disposed to trust myself\\r\\namong the Indians without my rifle. Indeed, I found it very serviceable\\r\\nduring the march, for the army never had more than half rations during\\r\\nthe whole campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My stock of bullets had become low from using them for hunting; and as\\r\\nsoon as it was daylight that morning, I started for the militia camp to\\r\\nget a ladle to pour some more. By this time the battle had begun, and I\\r\\nmet the militia running into the main body of troops. I hailed one of'], ['the Kentuckians, whom I found disabled in the right wrist by a bullet;\\r\\nand I asked him if he had bullets to spare. He told me to take out his\\r\\npouch and to divide with him. I poured out a double handful, put back\\r\\nwhat I supposed was half, and was about to leave him, when he said,\\r\\n‘Stop, you had better count them.’ I could hardly resist the impulse to\\r\\nlaugh, for the idea of counting a handful of bullets was ludicrous under\\r\\nthe circumstances. ‘If we get through this day’s scrape, my dear\\r\\nfellow,’ said I, ‘I will return you twice as many.’ But I never saw him\\r\\nagain, and I suppose he shared the fate that befell many a gallant\\r\\nspirit on that day. I owe the bullets, at any rate, at this moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I returned to the lines, I found that the engagement had begun.\\r\\nOne of Captain Piatt’s men lay shot through the belly near the spot I\\r\\nhad left. I saw an Indian behind a small tree not twenty steps away and\\r\\njust outside the regular lines. He was loading his piece, squatting down\\r\\nas much as possible to screen himself. I sighted and shot him through;\\r\\nhe dropped as soon as I had fired, and I retreated into our lines to\\r\\nreload my rifle. Finding that the fire had ceased at this point, I ran\\r\\nto the rear line, where I met Colonel Darke leading a charge with about\\r\\nthree hundred men. I followed with my rifle. By this movement the\\r\\nIndians were driven out of sight, and the Colonel called a halt to rally\\r\\nhis men. A number of trees had been blown down near where we stood. As\\r\\nan experienced woodsman and hunter, I suggested to Colonel Darke that\\r\\nthese trees would form an excellent breastwork of sufficient length to\\r\\nprotect the whole force. We might yet need that protection, for judging\\r\\nby the shouting and firing, the Indians behind us had closed the gap we\\r\\nhad made in charging. I told the Colonel that if we turned and charged\\r\\nthe Indians at our rear, we should have them with their backs to us. No\\r\\ndoubt we would be able to give a good account of them. ‘Lead the way,\\r\\nthen,’ said the Colonel, as he rode to the rear to march the whole body\\r\\nforward. We then charged the Indians, but they were so thick that we\\r\\ncould do nothing with them. In a few minutes they had surrounded us, and\\r\\nwe found ourselves beside the army baggage and the artillery, which had\\r\\nbeen captured. I then climbed a tree. After firing twelve or fourteen\\r\\ntimes, two or three rods being my longest shot, I discovered that many\\r\\nof those whom I had struck were not brought down. I had not then had\\r\\nsufficient experience to know that I must shoot them in the hip to bring\\r\\nthem down. The unprotected regulars armed with muskets could do little\\r\\nbetter than to fire at random.\\r\\n\\r\\n    [Illustration: _While he was crawling away_]\\r\\n\\r\\n“By this time only about thirty men of Colonel Darke’s command were left\\r\\nstanding; the rest were lying around us, either killed or wounded. I ran\\r\\nto the Colonel, who was waving his sword in the thickest of it to\\r\\nencourage his men, and told him we should all be down in five minutes if\\r\\nwe did not charge. ‘Charge, then!’ said he to the little line that\\r\\nremained, and they did so. Fortunately, the main army charged on the\\r\\nother side at the same time, and the Indians were momentarily put to\\r\\nflight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had been partially sheltered by a small tree, but two Indians behind\\r\\na larger tree fired simultaneously at me. Feeling the stream of air\\r\\nfollowing the passage of their shots, I supposed myself cut to pieces;\\r\\nbut no harm had been done. I brought my piece to my side and fired\\r\\nwithout aiming at the one that stood his ground. The fellow was so close\\r\\nto me that I could hardly miss him, and I shot him through the hips.\\r\\nWhile he was crawling away on all fours, Colonel Darke, who had\\r\\ndismounted and stood close by me, cut off the Indian’s head. By this\\r\\ntime the cock of my rifle lock had worn loose and gave me much trouble.\\r\\nI told my difficulty to an acquaintance from Cincinnati who had picked\\r\\nup a gun from a militiaman. ‘There is a first-rate rifle,’ he said,\\r\\npointing to one at a distance. I ran to get it as soon as I ascertained\\r\\nthat my bullets would fit it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here I met Captain J. S. Gano, who was unarmed. I handed him the rifle\\r\\nI had gone into the battle with, and I told him that we were defeated\\r\\nand would have to make our escape as speedily as possible. If we\\r\\nescaped, we would need the rifles for subsistence in the woods. While\\r\\nthe battle still raged, a group of soldiers had gathered together, but\\r\\nthey did little more than present targets for the enemy. The soldiers\\r\\nappeared stupefied and bewildered. At another spot a group of soldiers\\r\\nhad broken into the officers’ marquees and were eating the breakfast\\r\\nfrom which the officers had been called. It must be remembered that\\r\\nneither officers nor men had eaten anything the whole morning. Some of\\r\\nthe men were shot down in the very act of eating.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just where I then stood, no Indians were visible, although their rifle\\r\\nballs were striking all around. At last I saw an Indian dash for a tree\\r\\nabout forty yards off. From this protection he loaded and fired four\\r\\ntimes, bringing down his man at every shot. He fired too quickly to give\\r\\nme a chance to aim at him. At length I got a range of two inches inside\\r\\nhis backbone and blazed away; down he fell, and I saw no more of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A short time later I heard the cry given by St. Clair and his adjutant\\r\\nsergeant to charge to the road. I ran through the disorganized army to\\r\\nwhere I had left my relative, Captain Piatt, and I told him that the\\r\\narmy was broken up and in full retreat. ‘Don’t say so,’ he replied. ‘You\\r\\nwill discourage my men, and I can’t believe it.’ I persisted a short\\r\\ntime, but finding him obstinate, I said, ‘If you will rush your fate, in\\r\\nGod’s name do it!’ I then ran off toward the rear of the army, which was\\r\\nrapidly retreating.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Piatt called, ‘Wait for me!’ It was no use to stop, for by this time\\r\\nthe savages were hardly twenty yards behind me. Being uncommonly active\\r\\nin those days, I soon got from the rear to the front of the troops; but\\r\\nI had great trouble in avoiding the bayonets which the retreating men\\r\\nhad thrown down with the sharp points toward their pursuers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It has been stated that the Indians followed us for thirty miles, but\\r\\nthis is not true. My duty as surveyor led me to mark the miles every day\\r\\nwe proceeded on our march, and it was therefore easy to ascertain how\\r\\nfar we were pursued. The Indians, after every other fire, fell back to\\r\\nload their rifles and regained the lost distance by running on afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Even during the last charge of Colonel Darke, the bodies of the dead\\r\\nand dying were shrouded with smoke and in the heavy morning frost looked\\r\\nlike so many pumpkins in a cornfield in December. It was on the fourth\\r\\nof November, and the day was severely cold for the season. My fingers\\r\\nbecame so benumbed at times that I had to take the bullets in my mouth\\r\\nand load from it, while I had the wiping rod in my hand to force them\\r\\ndown.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe map of the battleground is taken from the survey of John S. Houston\\r\\nof Celina. The localities were pointed out to him by Mr. McDowell, who\\r\\nwas in the action and who is now living near Fort Recovery. In a letter\\r\\nheaded Celina, March 20, 1847, Mr. Houston reported on a conversation\\r\\nwith Mr. McDowell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. McDowell states that on the morning of the battle he and several\\r\\nothers had just gone out to look after their horses when suddenly they\\r\\nheard discharges of musketry and the most hideous yells from the'], ['opposite side of the river. Instantly, he rushed to camp where his\\r\\nregiment was preparing for action. He joined them and gallantly charged\\r\\nthe enemy. On the retreat he was among those who defended the rear and\\r\\nkept the enemy in check for several miles. The ground was covered with a\\r\\nslushy snow which greatly retarded their progress. After a while many\\r\\nsoldiers became so dispirited and hungry—having eaten no breakfast—that\\r\\nthey threw down their arms and made their way as best they could among\\r\\nthe retreating crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“About this time, Mr. McDowell saw a mother carrying her year-old\\r\\ninfant. She was so tired that she was about to fall by the wayside when\\r\\nhe took the child and carried it some distance. Afterward, to save her\\r\\nown life, the woman left the child in the snow. The Indians carried it\\r\\nto the Sandusky towns and reared it. Soon after this, McDowell overtook\\r\\na youth about eighteen years old who was hobbling along, wounded in the\\r\\nleg. McDowell gave him a drink of spirits and a little bread, although\\r\\nhe himself had not had time to eat. This refreshed and encouraged the\\r\\nyoung man; and when a pony came dashing by, McDowell caught it and\\r\\nmounted the young soldier upon it. In this way the youth reached the\\r\\nfort safely.\\r\\n\\r\\n    [Illustration: PLAN OF ST. CLAIR’S BATTLEFIELD]\\r\\n\\r\\n                              REFERENCES:\\r\\n  A.

SITE OF FORT RECOVERY BUILT BY WAYNE\\r\\n\\r\\n    from Historical Collection of Ohio by Howe.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At Stillwater Creek, twelve miles from the battleground, the Indians\\r\\ngave up the pursuit and returned to share the booty. ‘Oh!’ said an old\\r\\nsquaw who died many years ago on the St. Mary’s River, ‘my arm that\\r\\nnight was weary scalping white man.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Some years ago,’ McDowell said to me (and here his cheeks became\\r\\nmoistened with tears), ‘I was traveling in Kentucky to visit a sister I\\r\\nhad not seen in many years. When I arrived at Georgetown, I entered my\\r\\nname on the hotel register with the place of my residence—Fort Recovery,\\r\\nOhio.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘After I had been sitting some time at ease before a comfortable fire,\\r\\na gentleman who had noticed the entry of my name and residence opened a\\r\\nfriendly conversation about the place and country. He soon remarked that\\r\\nhe was at the defeat of St. Clair, and that if it had not been for the\\r\\nassistance of a young man of Butler’s regiment, he would have been there\\r\\nyet.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“After a few more questions and replies, both men recognized each other.\\r\\nThe gentleman was the youth who had been shot during the retreat and\\r\\nwhose life had been saved with McDowell’s assistance. At this discovery\\r\\ntheir surprise and consequent mutual attachment may be imagined. The\\r\\ngentleman insisted upon taking McDowell home and introducing him to his\\r\\nwife and daughters. He had become a wealthy merchant and gave McDowell a\\r\\nnew suit of clothes and other presents which he has carefully preserved\\r\\nto this day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his SKETCHES OF WESTERN ADVENTURE, John A. McClung relates some\\r\\nanecdotes which show the heroism and activity of a young man who was in\\r\\nthis action.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The late William Kennan, of Fleming County, when a young man of\\r\\neighteen, was attached to the corps of rangers who accompanied the\\r\\nregular force. He had long been noted for his strength and activity. In\\r\\nthe course of the march from Fort Washington, he had repeated\\r\\nopportunities to test his astonishing physical powers; and it was\\r\\nuniversally admitted that he was the swiftest runner in the light corps.\\r\\nOn the evening preceding the action, his corps had been advanced a few\\r\\nhundred yards in front of the first line of infantry in order to give\\r\\nreasonable notice of the enemy’s approach. Just as day was dawning, he\\r\\nobserved about thirty Indians within one hundred yards of the guards’\\r\\nfire. They advanced cautiously toward the spot where he stood with about\\r\\ntwenty rangers; the other men were considerably in the rear.\\r\\n\\r\\n    [Illustration: _mounted the young soldier_]\\r\\n\\r\\n“Supposing it to be a mere scouting party, numbering no more than the\\r\\nrangers, he sprang forward a few paces in order to shelter himself in a\\r\\nspot of rank grass. After firing with a quick aim upon the foremost\\r\\nIndian, Kennan instantly fell flat upon his face and proceeded with all\\r\\npossible rapidity to reload his gun. He did not doubt for a moment that\\r\\nthe rangers would maintain their positions and support him. The Indians,\\r\\nhowever, rushed forward in such overwhelming numbers that the rangers\\r\\nwere compelled to run. Kennan was in total ignorance of his danger until\\r\\nhis captain, who had observed him when he threw himself into the grass,\\r\\nsuddenly shouted, ‘Run, Kennan! or you are a dead man!’ Instantly,\\r\\nKennan sprang to his feet and beheld Indians within ten feet of him; his\\r\\ncompany was already more than one hundred yards in front.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a moment was to be lost. He darted off with every muscle strained\\r\\nto its utmost. A dozen yelling Indians were close behind him. At first\\r\\nhe pressed straight forward to the ford in the creek which separated the\\r\\nrangers from the main army. Several Indians, who had passed him before\\r\\nhe rose from the grass, threw themselves in the way and completely cut\\r\\nhim off from the other rangers. By the most powerful exertions, he left\\r\\nall of the pursuers behind him, with the exception of one chief who\\r\\ndisplayed a swiftness and perseverance equal to his own. The circuit\\r\\nwhich Kennan was obliged to take extended the race for more than four\\r\\nhundred yards. The distance between them was about eighteen feet, which\\r\\nKennan could not increase nor his adversary diminish. Each runner put\\r\\nhis whole soul into the race.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kennan, as far as he was able, kept his eye upon the motions of his\\r\\npursuer, for he was afraid the Indian would throw the tomahawk which he'], ['held aloft in a menacing position. At length, finding that no other\\r\\nIndian was immediately at hand, Kennan determined to try the mettle of\\r\\nhis pursuer in a different manner. He felt for his own tomahawk but\\r\\ndiscovered it had slipped out of its sheath while he lay in the grass.\\r\\nHis hair almost lifted the cap from his head when he realized he was\\r\\ntotally unarmed! Kennan had slackened his pace for a moment, and the\\r\\nIndian was almost in reach of him when he again sprinted forward. Fear\\r\\nlent wings to his feet, and for the first time he saw himself\\r\\noutdistancing the Indian. He had watched the motions of his pursuer too\\r\\nclosely, however, to pay proper attention to the nature of the ground\\r\\nbefore him; and he suddenly found himself in front of a large tree which\\r\\nhad been blown down. Brush and other impediments increased the height of\\r\\nthe obstacle to eight or nine feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Indian, who heretofore had not uttered the slightest sound, now\\r\\ngave a short, quick yell as if sure of his victim. Kennan had not a\\r\\nmoment to deliberate. He must clear the tree at a leap or perish.\\r\\nPutting his whole soul into the effort, he bounded into the air with a\\r\\npower that astonished himself. Clearing limbs, brush, and everything\\r\\nelse, he alighted in perfect safety on the other side. A loud yell of\\r\\nastonishment burst from his pursuer, who had not the hardihood to\\r\\nattempt the same feat. Kennan, as may be readily imagined, had no\\r\\nleisure to enjoy his triumph but dashed into the bed of the creek. With\\r\\nits high banks shielding him from the fire of the enemy, he ran up the\\r\\nstream until he found a convenient place to cross. Soon he rejoined the\\r\\nrangers in the rear of the encampment. He was panting from the fatigue\\r\\nof exertions which have seldom been surpassed, but no breathing time was\\r\\nallowed him. The attack instantly commenced and, as we have already\\r\\nobserved, was maintained for three hours with unabated fury.\\r\\n\\r\\n    [Illustration: _he alighted in perfect safety_]\\r\\n\\r\\n“When the retreat commenced, Kennan was attached to Major Clark’s\\r\\nbattalion which was assigned the task of protecting the rear. This corps\\r\\nquickly lost its commander and was completely disorganized. Kennan was\\r\\namong the hindmost when the fight commenced; but by exerting those same\\r\\npowers which had saved him in the morning, he quickly gained the front\\r\\nand passed several horsemen in the flight. Here he beheld a private of\\r\\nhis own company, an intimate acquaintance, lying upon the ground with\\r\\nhis thigh broken. In the most piercing tones of distress, the wounded\\r\\nman implored each horseman who hurried by to take him up behind him. As\\r\\nsoon as he beheld Kennan coming on foot, he stretched out his arms and\\r\\ncalled aloud for help. Notwithstanding the imminent peril of the moment,\\r\\nKennan could not reject so passionate an appeal and carried him for\\r\\nseveral hundred yards. Horseman after horseman passed them, but each\\r\\nrider refused to take the wounded man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At length the enemy was gaining upon them so fast that Kennan saw their\\r\\ndeaths to be certain unless he relinquished his burden. Accordingly, he\\r\\ntold his friend that he had used every possible exertion to save his\\r\\nlife and that he must relax his hold around his neck or they would both\\r\\nperish. The unhappy man, heedless of every remonstrance, still clung\\r\\nconvulsively and impeded Kennan’s exertions until the foremost of the\\r\\nenemy, armed with tomahawk alone, was within twenty yards of them.\\r\\nKennan then drew his knife from its sheath and cut the fingers of his\\r\\ncompanion. The unhappy man rolled upon the ground in utter helplessness.\\r\\nHe was tomahawked before Kennan had gone thirty yards. Relieved of his\\r\\nburden, Kennan darted forward with a speed which once more brought him\\r\\nto the front. Here again he was compelled to neglect his own safety in\\r\\norder to attend to that of others.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The late Governor George Madison of Kentucky, who afterward commanded\\r\\nthe troops who defended themselves so honorably at Raisin River, was a\\r\\nman of amiable temper and unconquerable courage. At that time, he was a\\r\\nsubaltern in St. Clair’s army. His health was poor; and now, totally\\r\\nexhausted by the exertions of the morning, he was calmly sitting on a\\r\\nlog awaiting the approach of his enemies. Kennan hastily accosted him\\r\\nand inquired the cause of his delay. Madison, pointing to a wound which\\r\\nhad bled profusely, replied that he was unable to walk any farther and\\r\\nthat he had no horse. Kennan instantly ran back to a spot where he had\\r\\nseen an exhausted horse grazing and caught it without difficulty. Having\\r\\nassisted Madison to mount, he walked beside the animal until they were\\r\\nout of danger. Fortunately, the pursuit soon ceased, as the plunder of\\r\\nthe camp presented irresistible attractions to the enemy. The friendship\\r\\nthus formed between these two young men endured without interruption for\\r\\nthe rest of their lives. Kennan never entirely recovered from the severe\\r\\nexertions which he had been compelled to make during this unfortunate\\r\\nexpedition. He settled in Fleming County where he was a leading member\\r\\nof the Baptist church for many years. He died in 1827.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of Indians engaged in this action can never be ascertained\\r\\nwith any degree of certainty. Estimates have varied from one to three\\r\\nthousand. Colonel John Johnston, long an Indian agent in this region,\\r\\nhad many opportunities to form a correct opinion on this subject. His\\r\\nstatements in a letter of 1846 are worthy of consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The number of Indians at the defeat of St. Clair must have been large.\\r\\nAt that time game was plentiful, and a large number of Indians could\\r\\nhave subsisted easily. Wells, one of our interpreters, was there and\\r\\nfought for the enemy. To use his own language, he tomahawked and scalped\\r\\nthe wounded, dying, and dead, until he was unable to raise his arm. The\\r\\nprincipal tribes in the battle were the Delaware, Shawnee, Wyandot,\\r\\nMiami, and Ottawa. A few Indians of the Chippewa and Potawatomi tribes\\r\\nwere also present. I had no accurate means of knowing the total number,\\r\\nbut it could not have been less than two thousand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time after the defeat of St. Clair, General Wilkinson, who had\\r\\nbecome commander of Fort Washington, ordered an expedition to visit the\\r\\nbattleground. Captain Buntin, who was with the party, afterward wrote a\\r\\nletter to St. Clair from which the following is extracted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In my opinion, those unfortunate men who were captured alive suffered\\r\\nthe greatest torture by having their limbs torn off. The women were\\r\\ntreated with the most indecent cruelty; stakes as thick as a person’s\\r\\narm were driven through their bodies. The former I observed while\\r\\nburying the dead; the latter was discovered by Colonel Sargeant and Dr.\\r\\nBrown. We found three carriages whole; the other five were so badly\\r\\ndamaged that they were useless. By the General’s orders, we dug pits in\\r\\ndifferent places and buried all the bodies that were exposed to view or\\r\\nthat could be found conveniently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“During this time several small parties were detached—some to protect\\r\\nthe main group and others to examine the course of the creek. At some\\r\\ndistance in front of the ground occupied by the militia, these parties\\r\\nfound a large camp, not less than three quarters of a mile long. They\\r\\nthought it had been the camp of the Indians the night before the action.\\r\\nWe remained on the field that night, and the next morning we hitched\\r\\nhorses to the carriages and started for Fort Jefferson.']]\n"

woman left the child in the the indians carried it to the sandusky towns and reared soon after mcdowell overtook a youth about eighteen years old who was hobbling wounded in the mcdowell gave him a drink of spirits and a little although he himself had not had time to this refreshed and encouraged the young and when a pony came dashing mcdowell caught it and mounted the young soldier upon in this

had not been for the assistance of a young man of he would have been there a few more questions and both men recognized each the gentleman was the youth who had been shot during the retreat and whose life had been saved with at this discovery their surprise and consequent mutual attachment may be the gentleman insisted upon taking mcdowell home and introducing him to his wife and he had become a wealthy merchant and gave mcdowell a new suit of clothes and other presents which he has carefully preserved to this in his sketches of western john mcclung relates some anecdotes which show the heroism and activity of a young man who was in this late william of fleming when a young man of was attached to the corps of rangers who accompanied the regular he had long been noted for his strength and in the course of the march from fort he had repeated opportunities to test his astonishing physical and it was universally admitted that he was the swiftest runner in the light on the evening preceding the his corps had been advanced a few hundred yards in front of the first line of infantry in order to give reasonable notice of the just as day was he observed about thirty indians within one hundred yards of the they advanced cautiously toward the spot where he stood with about twenty the other men were considerably in the the young it to be a mere scouting numbering no more than the he sprang forward a few paces in order to shelter himself in a spot of rank after firing with a quick aim upon the foremost kennan instantly fell flat upon his face and proceeded with all possible rapidity to reload his he did not doubt for a moment that the rangers would maintain their positions and support the rushed forward in such overwhelming numbers that the rangers were compelled to kennan was in total ignorance of his danger until his who had observed him when he threw himself into the suddenly or you are a dead kennan sprang to his feet and beheld indians within ten feet of his company was already more than one hundred yards in a moment was to be he darted off with every muscle strained to its a dozen yelling indians were close behind at first he pressed straight forward to the ford in the creek which separated the rangers from the main several who had passed him before he rose from the threw themselves in the way and completely cut him off from the other by the most powerful he left all of the pursuers behind with the exception of one chief who displayed a swiftness and perseverance equal to his the circuit which kennan was obliged to take extended the race for more than four hundred the distance between them was about eighteen which kennan could not increase nor his adversary each runner put his whole soul into the as far as he was kept his eye upon the motions of his for he was afraid the indian would throw the tomahawk which he', 'held aloft in a menacing at finding that no other indian was immediately at kennan determined to try the mettle of his pursuer in a different he felt for his own tomahawk but discovered it had slipped out of its sheath while he lay in the his hair almost lifted the cap from his head when he realized he was totally kennan had slackened his pace for a and the indian was almost in reach of him when he again sprinted fear lent wings to his and for the first time he saw himself outdistancing the he had watched the motions of his pursuer too to pay proper attention to the nature of the ground before and he suddenly found himself in front of a large tree which had been blown brush and other impediments increased the height of the obstacle to eight or nine who heretofore had not uttered the slightest now gave a quick yell as if sure of his kennan had not a moment to he must clear the tree at a leap or putting his whole soul into the he bounded into the air with a power that astonished clearing and everything he alighted in perfect safety on the other a loud yell of astonishment burst from his who had not

he found a convenient place to soon he rejoined the rangers in the rear of the he was panting from the fatigue of exertions which have seldom been but no breathing time was allowed the attack instantly commenced as we have already was maintained for three hours with unabated alighted in perfect the retreat kennan was attached to major battalion which was assigned the task of protecting the this corps quickly lost its commander and was completely kennan was among the hindmost when the fight but by exerting those same powers which had saved him in the he quickly gained the front and passed several horsemen in the here he beheld a private of his own an intimate lying upon the ground with his thigh in the most piercing tones of the wounded man implored each horseman who hurried by to take him up behind as soon as he beheld kennan coming on he stretched out his arms and called aloud for notwithstanding the imminent peril of the kennan could not reject so passionate an appeal and carried him for several hundred horseman after horseman passed but each rider refused to take the wounded length the enemy was gaining upon them so fast that kennan saw their deaths to be certain unless he relinquished his he told his friend that he had used every possible exertion to save his life and that he must relax his hold around his neck or they would both the unhappy heedless of every still clung convulsively and impeded exertions until the foremost of the armed with tomahawk was within twenty yards of kennan then drew his knife from its sheath and cut the fingers of his the unhappy man rolled upon the ground in utter he was tomahawked before kennan had gone thirty relieved of his kennan darted forward with a speed which once more brought him to the here again he was compelled to neglect his own safety in order to attend to that of late governor george madison of who afterward commanded the troops who defended themselves so honorably at raisin was a man of amiable temper and unconquerable at that he was a subaltern in his health was and totally exhausted by the exertions of the he was calmly sitting on a log awaiting the approach of his kennan hastily accosted him and inquired the cause of his pointing to a wound which had bled replied that he was unable to walk any farther and that he had no kennan instantly ran back to a spot where he had seen an exhausted horse grazing and caught it without having assisted madison to he walked beside the animal until they were out of the pursuit soon as the plunder of the camp presented irresistible attractions to the the friendship thus formed between these two young men endured without interruption for the rest of their kennan never entirely recovered from the severe exertions which he had been
